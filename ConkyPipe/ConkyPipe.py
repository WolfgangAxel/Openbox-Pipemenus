# This script operates under the assumption that you have a directory
# with a bunch of .conkyrc files (henceforth referred to as /conky).
#             Default assumption is ~/.config/conky)
# It also assumes that you have conky set up to open ~/.conkyrc
# This script is somewhat limited since it only allows for one conky
# to be loaded. It works for my needs, if it doesn't for you, feel
# free to suggest an update.
